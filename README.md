## About
Welcome to the mono-repo of the PhD course AI for Business Research (DSME 6635) at CUHK Business School in Spring 2024. You may download the [Syllabus](https://github.com/rphilipzhang/AI-PhD-S24/blob/main/AI-PhD-Syllabus-S2024.pdf) of this course first. The purpose of this course is to learn the following:

- Have a basic understanding of the fundamental concepts/methods in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) that are used (or potentially useful) in business research.
- Understand how business researchers have utilized ML/AI and what managerial questions have been addressed by ML/AI in the recent decade.
- Nurture a taste of what the state-of-the-art AI/ML technologies can do in the ML/AI community and, potentially, in your own research field.

We will meet each Tuesday at 12:30pm in Cheng Yu Tung Building (CYT) **LT5** (please pay attention to this room change). Please ask for my approval if you need to join us via the following Zoom links:

- [Zoom link](https://cuhk.zoom.us/j/99642393764?pwd=KzdHajlNb1FXM05kaFA5NEs5UlNzdz09), Meeting ID 996 4239 3764, Passcode 386119. 

Most of the code in this course will be distributed through the [Google CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/) cloud computing environment to avoid the incompatibility and version control issues on your local individual computer. On the other hand, you can always download the Jupyter Notebook from CoLab and run it your own computer.

- The **CoLab** files of this course can be found at [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Tn2I26ZUJ4qPosPOJOD3Yoy8o3lr8Q_G?usp=sharing).
- The **Google Sheet** to sign up for groups and group tasks can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nOE-saTptG73WMCONDB1Z3pt-jHhmDA_1OHpQVHqQ1M/edit?usp=sharing).
